### 🌱 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student and **AI Engineer in progress** focused on building production-ready GenAI agents and full-stack applications.

I do not optimize for Jupyter Notebook demos. I optimize for **systems that solve real problems, win hackathons, and provide value to users.**

My work spans applied machine learning, **Agentic Systems**, NLP, **Computer Vision**, and end-to-end full stack development. I enjoy owning the full lifecycle from idea to deployment—evidenced by my research publications and wins at **#LeadWithAIAgents** and **ReverieHacks**.

Currently refining my skills in **Generative AI** and building scalable tools like **Lawco** and **VisionSpeak**.
